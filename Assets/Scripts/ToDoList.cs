                                            STATE OF THE PROJECT 
    
    - Player can move left and right, collect collectibles and see how many they have gotten in the UI, collide with obsatcles to trigger the game over text.
    - I am currently trying to increase the speed based on number of blocks passed



                                            FURTHER MODIFICATIONS 

    - Use Collider Method to detect when an Enemy crosses the game state object instead of OnTriggerEnter
    - Use distance or time to upgrade diffculty
